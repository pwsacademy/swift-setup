# Fedora 40

[**Fedora**](https://www.fedoraproject.org) has excellent support for Swift and even provides a native package for easy installation.

To install Swift on Fedora, open the **Terminal** application and run the following command:

```
sudo dnf install -y swift-lang
```

> **Note**: This command requires administrator privileges, so itâ€™ll ask for your password.

You can now execute the `swift` command to verify which version you have installed:

```
swift --version
```
