# Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

[**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com) was the first Linux distribution to support Swift. Together with [Visual Studio Code](../../editors/vscode-linux/README.md), it makes an excellent development platform for students using Linux.

## Installation

These instructions rely on the [**Swift Community Apt Repository**](https://swiftlang.xyz).

Open the **Terminal** application and run the following commands to install this repository:

```
sudo apt install -y curl
curl -s https://archive.swiftlang.xyz/install.sh | sudo bash
```

You can now install the latest release of Swift with the following command:

```
sudo apt install swiftlang
```

Finally, verify that you can run the following command:

```
swift --version
```
