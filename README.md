# Swift Setup

This repository describes how you can set up a development environment for the [Swift programming language](https://swift.org).

Our goal is to support the adoption of Swift as a general purpose cross-platform programming language in education. To that end, we provide student-friendly instructions for various platforms, editors, and IDEs that support Swift.

If youâ€™re interested in learning Swift, please see our [Programming with Swift: Fundamentals](https://www.pwsacademy.org/courses/pws-fundamentals.html) course, for which this repository is a supporting resource.
